ðŸŒŸ Simple CRUD Operation Project Structure:

1. Create a Java project (e.g., using Maven or Gradle) with the following components:
   - Controller layer (handling REST API endpoints)
   - Service layer (business logic)
   - Repository layer (data access using JPA/Hibernate)

2. Implemented CRUD operations for a sample entity (e.g., `Product`):
   - GET: Retrieve all products and specific product by ID
   - POST: Create a new product
   - PUT: Update an existing product
   - DELETE: Delete a product by ID

3. Implemented custom exception handling:
   - Define custom exceptions (e.g., `ResourceNotFoundException`, `BadRequestException`)
   - Use exception handlers in the controller to return appropriate HTTP responses

4. Implemented custom response handling:
   - Create response DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for different API responses
   - Use these DTOs to structure API responses with consistent formats

5. Used SonarLint for code quality checks:
   - Integrate SonarLint in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
   - Follow SonarLint's suggestions for improving code quality and maintainability

6. Documented my API using Swagger:
   - Add Swagger dependencies to your project (e.g., springfox-swagger2 for Spring Boot)
   - Annotate your controller methods with Swagger annotations to describe API endpoints
   - Generate API documentation using Swagger UI
   
7. Testing with Postman:
   - Set up Postman collections for testing each CRUD operation
   - Test GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests with different data scenarios
